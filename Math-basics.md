# Introduction
Here you will find some mathematical knowledge you may need in 3D graphics at some point. Same as with the [programming basics explanation](programming-basics) we will use **simplification** and **analogies** so the theory given here is **not accurate** but its **easy for understanding** basic concepts at the beginning.

# Theory
## Coordinate systems
The coordinate systems are used to define a **point position in space**. In other words, it gives you the ability to **get** numeric point **coordinates** within a particular environment. 

By the space (or environment) in human experience, we mean our world. Since math is an abstraction space definition ...
