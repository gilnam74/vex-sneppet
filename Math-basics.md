# Introduction
Here you will find some mathematical knowledge you may need in 3D graphics at some point. Same as with the [programming basics explanation](programming-basics) we will use **simplification** and **analogies** so the theory given here is **not accurate** but its **easy for understanding** basic concepts at the beginning.

# Theory
## Coordinate systems
The coordinate systems are used to define a **point position in space**. In other words, it gives you the ability to **get** or **set** numeric point **coordinates** within a particular environment. The core of any coordinate system is an **Origin** â€” a place where all coordinates are equal to a 0, where all space begins.

By the space (or environment) in human experience, we mean our world. Since math is an abstraction space definition in math is also an abstraction, this means
