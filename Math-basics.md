# Introduction
Here you will find some mathematical knowledge you may need in 3D graphics at some point. Same as with the [programming basics explanation](programming-basics) we will use **simplification** and **analogies** so the theory given here is **not accurate** but its **easy for understanding** basic concepts at the beginning.

Math is a pure [abstraction](#abstraction). It was designed by humans to describe our world in a general way. To understand math concepts developed during hundreds of years we will get back to the real world and explain these concepts as particular examples. 

Numbers and counting, the very basic mathematical stuff, is an abstraction: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 has no representation in reality. But we can count all apples in the basket and explain number concept with a help of real objects. This is how the **analogy** works and we will extensively use this technique here.

# Geometry
Here we deal with shape, size and position of objects.

## Coordinate systems
The coordinate systems are used to define a **point position in space**. In other words, it gives you the ability to **get** or **set** numeric point **coordinates** within a particular environment. 

By the space (or environment) we mean our universe. But in human experience universe is a non-intuitive environment, we used to a much fewer scales, such as our home, a street or maybe a city. To get the intuitive analogy of environment we can limit the universe to the room where you are currently located. So how we can get numeric values of your position in the room?

To get or set values (measure them) we need a measuring tape. This tape is called an **Axis** of the coordinate system. We can use a different amount of axis to determinate a coordinate system. One axis will give us a representation of one-dimensional space (hard to imagine how you would feel yourself in the one-dimensional world, right?). Since our universe is 3-dimensional, we would need 3 axes to get an [abstraction](#abstraction) of the real world dimensions with math.

Besides axes, we need to define one more core item of the coordinate system â€” the beginning point, a place where all axis starts (where all coordinates are equal to a 0). The item is called an **Origin** and we may arbitrary define an origin in the real environment: let it be the bottom left corner of the room.

# Trigonometry
Trigonometry is all about **length** and **angles** in **triangles**. Since the angle is a rotation equivalent and full rotation gives us a circle, trigonometry heavily relies on the circle as well.
