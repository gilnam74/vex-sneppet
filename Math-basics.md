# Introduction
Here you will find some mathematical knowledge you may need in 3D graphics at some point. Same as with the [programming basics explanation](programming-basics) we will use **simplification** and **analogies** so the theory given here is **not accurate** but its **easy for understanding** basic concepts at the beginning.

# Theory
## Coordinate systems
The coordinate systems are used to define a **point position in space**. In other words, it gives you the ability to **get** or **set** numeric point **coordinates** within a particular environment. 

By the space (or environment) we mean our universe. But in human experience universe is a non-intuitive environment, we used to a much fewer scales, such as our home, a street or maybe a city. To get the intuitive analogy of environment we can limit the universe to the room where you are currently located. So how we can get numeric values of your position in the room?

To get or set values (measure them) we need a measuring tape. This tape is called an **Axis** of the coordinate system. We can use a different amount of axis to determinate a coordinate system. One axis will give us a representation of one-dimensional space (hard to imagine how you would feel yourself on one-dimensional world, right?). But our universe is 3-dimensional , so we would need 3 axes to get an [abstraction](#Abstraction) of real world with math. 

The core of any coordinate system is an **Origin** â€” a place where all coordinates are equal to a 0, where all space begins.


Since math is an abstraction space definition in math is also an abstraction, this means
