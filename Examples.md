#### Infection algorythm
Scatter points, infect arbitrary points, simulate infection of other points.

#### Visualize and use VEX noise to delete points
Paint geometry (points) to black and white colors using noise pattern. Adjust noise look with "Size", "Offset" and "Threshold" parameters. Randomly delete (or paint with red color) black or white parts with "Delete White" and "Delete Black" sliders. To switch between deleting and painting use "Delete/Pint" toggle.
