# Introduction
Despite this course is oriented on the Computer Graphic field (and Houdini in particular) it could be useful for anybody else who decided to learn how to code from the beginning.

Everybody can write code at some level even without any relevant knowledge. The majority of questions you might have while you write your first line of code already answered online. So it is possible to produce working code for your daily needs without proper education.

But if you would like to have better control over the computer with a code you will need to understand how it works at the lowest possible level. This knowledge is called Computer Science and here we will make the first step in mastering it

# How a computer works

# Data structures and algorithms
## Data Structures

#### Hash Tables
The **hash function** generates a value of fixed length for each input. The resulting value, random pattern, will be always the same for the same input.

```c
// Pseudocode
hash_function("Hello, World!") = 0A0A9F2A6772942557AB5355D76AF442F8F65E01
```
It's practically impossible to get the source value from the result.
