## What is EVE?
EVE is an out of the box Houdini production pipeline. Download this repo as a zip file, extract, build a new project with a [Create Project](tools#create-project) tool and you are ready to manage and deliver the CGI magic! 

## What can I learn about Houdini here?
Currently, [VEX for artists](vex-for-artists) and [Python for artists](python-for-artists) sections are **the best place to start**. Don't miss [Programming basics](programming-basics) if you don't have a programming experience!
