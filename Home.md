Wellcome to **Houdini Pipeline Wiki** 

In future, this repository would include a complete Houdini Pipeline Toolkit and documentation, same as [Animation DNA](https://github.com/kiryha/AnimationDNA/wiki) for Maya, but now it contains only learning resources: some tips, tutorials, code snippets etc. 

Currently, [VEX for artists](vex-for-artists) and [Python for artists](python-for-artists) sections are **the best place to start**. Don't miss [Programming basics](programming-basics) if you don't have a programming experience!

[Houdini Basics](houdini-basics) — General Houdini techniques and triks  
[Math basics](Math-basics) — Math theory for artists  
[Programming basics](programming-basics) — Programming concepts for artists  
[Python in Houdini](python) | [Python snippets](python-snippets) — Python in Houdini usage  
[VEX for artists](vex-for-artists) | [VEX snippets](vex-snippets) — VEX code examples  
[HIP Examples](examples) — Tehniques as HIP files   
[Tutorials](tutorials) — Tehniques with step by step descriptions
