# Unsorted data
## Basic solution patterns
An algorithm is a step by step instruction for solving a problem. Those steps could be organized into the patterns, basic blocks of a problem solution. Pattern, like a programming function, does a simple and obvious action. For example, traveling through each element of the list is a pattern, which could be implemented in Python with a `for loop`.

Here I will record all patterns recognized while learning algorithms.

### Walkthrough each element in the array.
One of the simplest pattern I can imagine. Do something with each element of the array.
```Python
list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
for element in list:
    print element
```
