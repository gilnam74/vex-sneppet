# Quick Start Introduction
If you want to learn VEX and Math beginning from the basics here is a good place to start. You need elementary knowledge of Houdini UI and understanding of core programming concepts. If you can render metal sphere in Houdini and know what is syntax, data types, variables and loops then you are fine to go (check [Programming Basics tutorial](Programming-basics) if not).

##### Create a wrangle in a fresh Houdini scene
- Press TAB in Node View, type `geometry`, hit ENTER
- Dive inside "Geometry" node, delete "File" node
- Press TAB, type `aw`, hit ENTER to create "Attribute Wrangle" node

If you need to **CREATE** data with Attribute Wrangle: switch **"Run Over"** parameter to **"Detail"**. If you will feed some data to Attribute Wrangle (connect any node to input) leave Run Over parameter at default Point state.

# VEX first steps
The goal here is to start with the very simple and basic tasks keeping the amount of code minimal and gradually, step by step increase complexity of exercises. If you will really understand the basics it would be easy to develop extra functionality for the staring code.

## Points
##### Point concept
Point is a basement of 3 Dimensional data representation and its a core entity in Houdini. Understanding points allow understanding a huge part of SOP context in Houdini. To make things simple you can consider the single point as a complete geometry of any complexity.

**Point** in Houdini is a basic container in 3D space with a number of **attributes** associated with it.  
**Attributes** are just variables to store data. The minimal amount of attributes is one: point position in the scene (`P`). Point position is a [vector](Programming-basics#data-types) attribute, it holds 3 float number: point position in X, Y and Z in the global coordinate system (scene). You can create another standard (Normal, Color, Velocity) or custom attributes of different data types for each point. All modeling and bunch of other operations in Houdini are just around creating and managing points and their attributes.

You can examine point attributes in **Geometry Spreadsheet** window.

##### Create a point
Create an [Attribute Wrangle](#create-a-wrangle-in-a-fresh-houdini-scene), set Run Over parameter to Detail.  
Now to create a point we need to know a [command](Programming-basics#commands) for that. Let`s use [Google Development Technique](https://github.com/kiryha/AnimationDNA/wiki/06-Tutorials#developing-with-google)!  

Search for "create point Houdini vex" and you will definitely find out that `addpoint()` will allow us to solve the task. Search for "addpoint vex" to read [Houdini documentation](http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/vex/functions/addpoint.html) on `addpoint()` command.

Always **start from reading the documentation** for the command you wish to use, even if explanation there would not have any sense for you. This could happen at the beginning, but you will get more and more benefits from docs later, just do it to **build an experience**.

One of possible usage of this command is: `int  addpoint(int geohandle, vector pos)`  
What can we learn from this? 
- First, this command returns **point number** (integer data type). Its simple, if you have 10 points, each of them will have its own index starting from `0`, ending with `9`. You can get access to a particular point (and point attributes) using this index. In the case with one point, we will have one point number equal zero.
- addpoint command required 2 arguments (inputs): integer "geohandle" and vector "pos". We would not go deep into geohandle concept, imagine it as a port for plugging some data and use `0` for its value, it will suit for the majority of cases. Second argument "Pos" is a vector position in 3D space, X, Y and Z coordinates of the created point.

So with `addpoint()` we will create a point in a given position in space.  
Lets do it, write in your Attribute Wrangle node:

```C
addpoind(0,0);
```
