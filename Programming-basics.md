# Programming Basics introduction
The goal of this section is to give artist fast understanding of core programming concepts to be able to follow [VEX tutorials](VEX-Quick-start) if the programming is Terra Incognita for him (or her). To explain complex things (and programming could be sophisticated for those who never have a deal with it or who consider himself an artist but not technician) we will use simplification and analogies. This is not even a first steps, **we learn to crawl here**.

**Simplification** is a focus on the main topic ignoring all surrounding exceptions and details. **Analogies** â€” explaining unknown with the notions which are intuitive (familiar without any extra knowledge to a majority of humans in the world). Both simplification and analogies yields to a faster understanding but less precision. Keep this in mind.

Syntax, data types, variables, commands, functions, loops.  

# Programming theory
Programming - speaking with PC. Instructions.
