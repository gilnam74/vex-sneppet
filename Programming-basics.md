# Programming Basics introduction
The goal of this section is to give artist fast understanding of core programming concepts to be able to follow [VEX tutorials](VEX-Quick-start) if the programming is Terra Incognita for him (or her). To explain complex things (and programming could be sophisticated for those who never have a deal with it or who consider himself an artist but not technician) we will use simplification and analogies. 

Simplification is a focus on the main topic ignoring all surrounding exceptions and details. It yields to a faster understanding but less precision. Analogies â€” explaining unknown with the notions which are intuitive without any extra knowledge for a majority of humans in the world. Analogies help to get an intuitive understanding but also suffer from lack of precision.

so be aware that these concepts are far from accurate definitions. This is not even a first steps, we learn to crawl here.
A good method to understand completely new stuff is the analogy. 

Syntax, data types, variables, commands, functions, loops.  

# Programming theory
Programming - speaking with PC. Instructions.
