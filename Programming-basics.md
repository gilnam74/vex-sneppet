# Programming Basics introduction
The goal of this section is to give artist **fast understanding** of core programming concepts to be able to follow [VEX tutorials](VEX-Quick-start) if the programming is Terra Incognita for him (or her). To explain complex things (and programming could be sophisticated for those who never have a deal with it or who consider himself an artist but not technician) we will use simplification and analogies. This is not even a first steps, **we learn to crawl here**.

**Simplification** is a focus on the main topic ignoring all surrounding exceptions and details. **Analogies** — explaining unknown with the notions which are intuitive (familiar without any extra knowledge to a majority of humans in the world). Both simplification and analogies yields to a faster understanding but less precision. Keep in mind that you may not pass an exam on computer science with such kind of knowledge but from the other side it would be possible to start applied developing without finishing computer science class.

At the end of the lesson, you should be comfortable with [syntax](#syntax), data types, variables, commands, functions, loops.  

# Programming theory
## Programming definition
Let's define programming first. **Programming** — is communication with a computer, how you can "speak" with this device. The more accurate definition would be: **giving precise instructions to a computer** to perform specific actions. Moreover, anything you want your computer to execute should be expressed in a way that your computer will understand. And the only thing computers understand is a program.

## Syntax
As you can speak different languages, computers understand different programming languages also.
