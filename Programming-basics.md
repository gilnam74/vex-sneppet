# Programming Basics introduction
The goal of this section is to give artist fast understanding of core programming concepts to be able to follow [VEX tutorials](VEX-Quick-start) if the programming is Terra Incognita for him (or her). To explain complex things (and programming could be sophisticated for those who never deal with it or who consider himself an artist but not technician) we will simplify every concept as much as it possible. Simplification yields to a better understanding but less precision, so be aware that these concepts are far from accurate definitions.

Syntax, data types, variables, commands, functions, loops.  

# Programming theory
Programming - speaking with PC. Instructions.
