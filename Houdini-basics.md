# Introduction
Here you will find Houdini general usage tips

## Project setup
Environment variables allow to setup variables and values in Houdini.  
List all available variables: run `cmds`, run command `hconfig.exe -a`  
Check the variable value in Houdini: in Texport window run `echo $<VAR_NAME>`  
Variables which works with paths divided into 2 types:  
- Location (HIP, JOB, etc), one specific directory
- Path (HOUDINI_SCRIPT_PATH, etc), list of dirs

`JOB` - root for Houdini project.  
`HIP` - path where Houdini scene is.  
`HOME` - Houdini settings for the user  
`HFS` - Houdini install dir

- **Togle** quickmarks: tilda

## Pipeline developing notes
#### Introduction
This repository is a Houdini pipeline toolset in the early stage of developing. Working name is "Mother". This section is my notes on developing process, it does not intend to have valuable public content. I mean, skip it!

Once released, Mother would be **out of the box VFX pipeline** for Houdini and Nuke applications under control of Shotgun management system.

Despite the Houdini data management part is not developed yet, the whole VFX pipeline structure is based on [Animation DNA](https://github.com/kiryha/AnimationDNA/wiki) ideas, so we have a concept for the project folder structure, assets structure etc.

#### Agile and Organic Pipeline
There is a well-known VFX production structure with strict vertical hierarchy and tasks division between departments. We well research agile project management option with task division between teams. 

The term "production pipeline" by itself defines our perception of movie making process. Obviously, we see the similarity between movie production and any other manufacturing where we use machines, tools and other mechanical devices. Such conception gives quite successful results.

However, we try to look at production process from the biological point of view and get some interesting ideas. The difference between machine and organism is similar to the difference between nodes and layers â€” the same task could be achieved differently and perception could define algorithms. Organic pipeline research is our goal here.

We are going to born shots with Mother...

#### Project-pipeline relation
At the highest level, there are two options for defining the relation between a pipeline and projects:
- One pipeline driving all projects  
- Each project has its own pipeline version  

The first option more suitable when you have a limited amount of big and complex long-term projects (like animation feature), second fits better for a bunch of fast tasks, like commercials. Here we will design the first option.

Sure, there is a third option available, a combination of this two methods, when you have one pipeline driving all projects and each project has the ability to customize pipeline individually.

#### Pipeline deploy
This is basically pipeline for pipeline developing. Where you keep source code, how you modify it and track changes, how you deliver pipeline to a production for the studio and for outsoursers.

#### Run new project.
Create a project [folder structure](https://github.com/kiryha/AnimationDNA/wiki/02-Codex-DNA#folder-structure) and place repo content in `<rootProject>/PREP/PIPELINE` to use Mother.  
TBD: create a script `projectBuild.py` to create a folder structure and pull pipeline from GitHub into a proper folder. 

#### Github developer notes
Install GitHub Desktop. Clone this repo to a PIPELINE folder of a project used to develop the pipeline `E:\256\PROJECTS\NSI\PREP\PIPELINE`.

Create a project in PyCharm, set PIPELINE folder as root.

Exclude PyCharm project folder (.idea) from GitHub commits: go to `PIPELINE/.git/info`, add `.idea` line to "exclude" file.
